# libp2p-stardust

A better ws-star implementation

# Todo

 - [ ] Integrate as libp2p transport
 - [ ] Add discovery
 - [ ] Split server into it's own repo

## Why?

ws-star is still a mess, rendezvous is still a work in progress and I just figured that it would be a good idea to do something about that

# Protocol

## [ Â» .proto definition file ](/src/rpc/proto.js?raw=true)

## Registration flow

```
Client                                                                                  Server

The client connects
Both the server and the client negotiate a muxer to use using multistream-select

The client sends a random 128-byte long string and it's peerID to the server
--[ JoinInit{random128: rand(128), peerID: $self.peerID.toJSON()} ]-------------------->

The server responds with either an error or an encrypted 128-byte salt (that was encrypted using the public key of the id)
<-[ JoinChallenge{ error?, saltEncrypted: encrypt(rand(128), id.pub ]-------------------

The client now decrypts the salt and builds a sha512 hash out of the random string and the salt
(This is so the server cannot make the client decrypt arbitrary data for him)
--[ JoinChallengeSolution{ solution: sha512(random128, decrypt(saltEncrypted, id.priv)->

The server also computes this hash and compares it to the client's solution
If both match, the server adds the client to the network, otherwise it responds with an error
<-[ JoinVerify{ error? } ]--------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Dialing flow

```
Client A                                Server                                  Client B

The client opens a muxed connection and sends the peerID of the target over that connection
--[ *opens connection* ]-------------->
--[ DialRequest{ target: <bytes> } ]-->

The server verifies if the client is online and responds with either an error or opens a connection to the other and forwards that over the existing connection
                                        --[ *opens connection* ]--------------->
<-[ DialRequest{ error? } ]------------
---------------------------------------->-[ *forwarded connection* ]----------->

After that the normal libp2p dialing flow is happening between A and B
```
